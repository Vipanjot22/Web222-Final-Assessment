                1. Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?<br>
                Ans.  Responsive design is a visual user interface (GUI) design strategy for creating content that adapts
                to different screen sizes without losing its quality. Designers use relative units (percentages) and media 
                queries to ensure that their designs adjust to the browser space and maintain content uniformity across 
                devices.
                Responsive design is a somewhat retro approach to web site design that addresses many of the design 
                issues that have arisen as a result of the growth of new sorts of mobile devices. Instead of fixed-width 
                settings, responsive design pages employ X and Y coordinates on a grid for layout and mathematical percentages 
                for pictures. Using percentages instead of fixed-width parameters with a grid layout results in a more fluid 
                layout that adapts to the size of the display.
                <br><br>
                2. How does responsive design relate to web technologies?<br>
                Ans. We're soon approaching the point where we won't be able to keep up with the never-ending new resolutions 
                and devices in the world of Web design and development. Creating a website version for each resolution and 
                each device would be unfeasible, or at the very least impracticable, for many websites. To resolve this, 
                we use idea of responsive web design in many ways. For example, there are many responsive web design tools 
                available to design and customise websites. One of them is Bootstrap. It is the most popular framework to 
                build a responsive and mobile first websites. It is basically a collection of usable code which is written in 
                html, CSS and JavaScript. Moreover, Bootstrap comes up with its own grid system which is predefined which we 
                can use easily. Also, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used in responsive web design to offer varied style 
                attributes based on the screen size, orientation, resolution, colour capabilities, and other aspects of 
                the user's device. The viewport and media queries are two examples of CSS attributes related to responsive web 
                design. responsive Web design is not only about adjustable screen resolutions and automatically resizable images, 
                but rather about a whole new way of thinking about design. 
                <br><br>
                3. What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?<br>
                Ans. I did learn about different concepts of web technologies while working on assignments. 
                One of the main concept is Responsive web design. Also, I learned that how can we create the forms in Html and
                then we can use different style on each tag and element with the help of CSS. HTML forms can be validated in 
                html by using pattern attribute. On the other side we can validate html form by using javascript validation 
                which we can do with the help of different functions and conditions. We can style our website exactly according 
                to our own requirements. I did learn about different CSS properties for designing our websites.
                <br><br> 
                4. Finally, describe your learning experience in the course.<br>
                Ans. My learning experience for web222 was great. I learned the core concepts of three main web programming 
                languages which is JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS. These are the languages with which we can need to make a web page. 
                In HTML5, I learned about html tags, elements and different attributes. Also, I got the knowledge on hyperlinks, anchors and 
                how to use JavaScript inside HTML file. Furthermore, I learned the scripting language JavaScript for creating dynamic web pages. 
                This course helps me to learn different data types, functions, built-in functions and objects in Javascript. 
                Also, I get hands on practice on CSS properties while working on my course assignments which is great addition to my knowledge. 
                At the end, I would like to say this course has given me so much information and knowledge in web development.
